# SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design
## Introduction
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. By adhering to these principles, developers can create systems that are easier to manage and extend over time.

This README provides a brief overview of each of the SOLID principles.

## The SOLID Principles
### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   Definition: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means you can add new functionality without changing existing code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   Definition: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This means creating specific interfaces for different clients, rather than one general-purpose interface.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion
By following the SOLID principles, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and flexible software. These principles help in managing the complexities of software development, ensuring that the system remains easy to understand and extend over time.
